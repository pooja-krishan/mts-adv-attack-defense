# Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting

This project explores the vulnerabilities of deep learning models in multivariate time-series forecasting to adversarial attacks. It demonstrates the impact of adversarial methods and proposes defenses to enhance model robustness. The experiments are structured into two datasets: electricity consumption (ELC) and hard disk drive failure (HDD).
